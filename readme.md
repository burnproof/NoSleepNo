This program stops your computer to go to idle.
This program starts and lives in taskbar and initiates keypress in every few seconds.
This is a replacement for widely used mouse movement solution, which I have found to
be quite unreliable as it interrupts other mouse actions at a time, especially if 
one tries to do some design related task, where 1px actually matters. 
The key pressed is configurable through app configuration file. I personally tend
to map F13 as as key to be pressed, as it is typically unused by any other application.
